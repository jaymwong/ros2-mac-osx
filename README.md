# ROS2 Mac OSX Support 
This is the natural extension of [ros1-mac-osx](https://github.com/jaymwong/ros1-mac-osx). The purpose of this repository is to hold a working copy of the libraries that has successfully built ROS on my Mac OSX machine. It's not elegant at all, in fact, it's very "hacky" and might clobber some existing `brew` packages on your machine. Regardless, I'm putting this together for my future self and the greater ROS community. That being said, I make no guarantees as to whether it will work for you. Good luck!
